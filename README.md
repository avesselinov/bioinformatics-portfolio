# Alexandra Vesselinov - Bioinformatics Portfolio

This repository contains **sample code and workflows** that demonstrate my skills in **bioinformatics, data science, and computational biology**. These examples reflect the type of work I’ve done through research internships, coursework, and independent projects.

---

## Repository Structure

**`/bash_hpc/`** – Bash scripts for HPC clusters (SLURM-based) to process NGS data  
**`/python_analysis/`** – Python notebooks for RNA-seq, metagenomics, and visualization  
**`/r_analysis/`** – R Markdown for RNA-seq differential expression using DESeq2  
**`/data/`** – Sample datasets used for demonstration (publicly available or simulated)

---

## Skills Demonstrated
**Python** (data cleaning, visualization, RNA-seq)  
**R** (statistical analysis, DESeq2, ggplot2)  
**Bash** (HPC scripts, SLURM jobs, NGS workflows)  
**Linux/Unix navigation**  
**Version control** (GitHub organization, commits)  

---

## Highlights

- **RNA-seq Analysis (Python)**: Normalization, visualization of gene expression, and bar plots of top genes.  
- **Differential Expression (R)**: Complete DESeq2 workflow with an MA plot and volcano plot.  
- **HPC SLURM Script**: Bash job script to run FASTQC, HISAT2 alignment, and SAM/BAM conversions on a cluster.
